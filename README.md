# Code-Quiz

    In this assignment I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a quiz that students can take. In this quiz are muultiple choice questions for them to answer. In total there are five questions that are timed. The student can also view the highscores of others who have taken the test. At the end of the quiz, it tells the student how many questions they have answered correctly and gives them their score.
